    README tweaks. Now using auto tabs to spaces and remove trailing
    white space which makes for lots of changes. Replaced erroneous
    instance of 'diff_for_humans' (Pendulum) with 'duration_in_words'
    now twith short option to retain only the two most significant
    periods from weeks, days, hours and minutes. Used for 'when' in
    email and text alerts.

    Implemented using @K <summary> entries to add links to as yet non
    existing inbox items with the provided summary and an @s entry
    corresponding to the current date. The inbox items are created and
    the resulting doc_id's added to an @k entry which replaces the @K
    entry. Reorganized menus and updated README accordingly. Pressing
    'J' in any mode, opens a 'daily' journal entry for the current
    date for editing, creating the item if it doesn't already exist.

    When opening konnected view, if an item is selected with an @k
    entry, then jump to that row in konnected view. When returning to
    konnected view from viewing konnections for an item, jump to the
    row corresponding to the last selection in konnections. Added
    discussion of Zettelkasten to the Konnected View section of
    README.

    Don't automatically archive items with @k entries. Use 4-digit
    years in detail and edit views to preserve century, e.g., to avoid
    1944/4/17 being saved as 44/4/17 and then interpreted as
    2044/4/17.
