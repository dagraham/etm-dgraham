    on the current date and the timedelta between the current moment
    and the datetime otherwise. Added 'inactive' to type_colors.

    Fixed probably longstanding bug in which removing an element from
    an item while editing, e.g., an @t tag, would apparently succeed
    but when saving the changes, the removed item would reappear. The
    standard tinydb update and upsert methods record adding new
    elements and making changes to existing elements but not removing
    an existing element. The solution is to obtain the doc_id of the
    item, delete the item and then insert the new, changed item using
    the original doc_id.
