    In row2id, skip 'wrapper' rows. When creating @K inbox entries
    insure that 'created' is added. In populating konnections_from and
    konnections_to, make sure that doc_ids correspond to existing data

    timestamps. Remove extra linebread in jinsa template for @d.

    Fixed bug in processing weekday entries in rrule specifications,
    e.g., '@r m &w 2TH'. Problem arises from the fact that the
    dateutil.rrule.weekday string representation for '2TH' is 'TH(+2)'
    which differs from the '2TH' needed by etm.

    Fixed probably longstanding bug in which removing an element from
    an item while editing, e.g., an @t tag, would apparently succeed
    but when saving the changes, the removed item would reappear. The
    standard tinydb update and upsert methods record adding new
    elements and making changes to existing elements but not removing
    an existing element. The solution is to obtain the doc_id of the
    item, delete the item and then insert the new, changed item using
    the original doc_id.

    Implemented using @K <summary> entries to add links to as yet non
    existing inbox items with the provided summary and an @s entry
    corresponding to the current date. The inbox items are created and
    the resulting doc_id's added to an @k entry which replaces the @K
    entry. Reorganized menus and updated README accordingly. Pressing
    'J' in any mode, opens a 'daily' journal entry for the current
    date for editing, creating the item if it doesn't already exist.
